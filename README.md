## Procedure for adding new microcopy to the repository:

1. Check if the microcopy is not already present 
2. If it is, maybe it's worth updating
3. If it's not, specify for what the microcopy should be used
4. Write an example of a bad microcopy for the same situation
5. Check out the [Markdown syntax](https://github.github.com/gfm/) if you are not sure how Markdown works
6. Enjoy as your microcopy takes its rightful place among others :)
