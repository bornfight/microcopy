# Contributing

## Procedure for adding new rules to the repository:

1. Check if the error is recurring or critical (important for everybody)
2. Check if the error is not covered by some of the previous rules
3. Write a rule to correct the mistake
4. Write a short code snippet (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/)
5. Keep it generic and avoid copy/pasting from private projects
6. Create a pull request and assign it to fajdof, tamaramilisa or d-srd
7. Enjoy as your rule takes its rightful place in the docs :)
